		<h2>Problem 1: Hands on Clock!</h2>
		<p>
			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
			You are given a clock that follows the twelve hour format.<br><br>Given time from 00:00 to 23:00, find the first time at which the hour hand and the minute hand overlap.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Input Format</h3>
* First line contains a single integer t, representing the number of test cases.<br>
* The next t lines, contain a single integer time, representing time from 0 hours to 23 hours<br><br>
			<h3>Constraints</h3>
* 1 <= t <= 24<br>
* 0 <= time <= 23<br><br>
			<h3>Output Format</h3>
* For each test case print a single line representing the time of overlap in the format hours:minutes<br>
* Hours must be in the range 1 to 12<br>
* Minutes must be in the range 0 to 59<br>
* Note: In case, time is 09:03 print 9:3. Similarly if time is 12:00 print 12:0<br><br>
			<h3>Sample Input 0</h3>
3<br>
23<br>
6<br>
12<br><br>
			<h3>Sample Output 0</h3>
12:0<br>
6:32<br>
12:0<br><br>
			<h3>Explanation 0</h3>
* Case 1: 23 hours represent 11 o clock in the 12 hours format.Thus the hand meet each other only after 60 minutes. Therefore output is 12:0<br>
* Case 2: 6 hours represents 6 o clock in the 12 hours format. In such a situation the clock meets after 32 minutes and 30 seconds. Therefore ouput is 6:32<br>
* Case 3: In this case the hands are initially at same same position. So no changes<br><br>

			<h2>Problem 2: Growth and Fall</h2>
			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Rachit plants a seed of a tree and expects it to reach a particular height h.The tree grows by a height, g units every week. Kiruba a naughty kid cuts the tree by f units by the end of each week.<br><br>
Find the week on which the tree attains the height, h<br><br>
			<h3>Input Format</h3>
* The first line contains a single integer t, representing the numebr of test cases<br>
* The next t lines contains three space seperated integers in the format "h g f", where,h is height to be reached, g is growth and f is the decrease in height<br><br>
			<h3>Constraints</h3>
* 1 <= t <= 1000<br>
* 1 <= h <= 10^8<br>
* 1 <= g <= 10^4<br>
* 0 <= f <= 10^2<br>
* f < g (always)<br><br>			
			<h3>Output Format</h3>
* For each test case print a single integer representing the week on which the tree attains the height, h<br><br>
			<h3>Sample Input 0</h3>
2<br>
30 4 2<br>
45 3 0<br><br>
			<h3>Sample Output 0</h3>
14<br>
15<br><br>
			<h3>Explanation</h3>
* Case 1: On the first week the tree grows 4 units and Kiruba cuts it by 2 units, therefore height becomes 2 units. On the second week the tree grows to a heigth of (4+2)=6 units and Kiruba cuts it to 4 units. Thus the tree will reach a height of 26 units after 13 weeks and on the 14th week the tree grows to a height of 30 units (before Kiruba cuts it)<br>
* Case 2: The tree grows 3 units each week but Kiruba does not cuts it. Thus it reaches a height of 45 units in 15 weeks<br><br>

			<h2>Problem 3: Kiruba's Favourite Number</h2>
			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Kiruba finds a set of numbers to be his favourite if they satisfy the following condition<br><br>
* Any given number is represented in binary, example binary(10) => 1010<br>
* When the binary representation is partitioned into two equal halves,then the two halves must be equal. Example 1010 => 10 | 10 .Thus 10 is one of his favourite number<br><br>
Given an array A of length N. Find the number of favourite numbers in the given array.<br><br>
			<h3>Input Format</h3>
* The first line contains a single integer,t representing the number of test cases<br>
* Each test case contains two lines<br>
* The first line of each test case contains a single integer,N representing the length of the array<br>
* The second line of each test case contains N space seperated integers<br><br>
			<h3>Constraints</h3>
* 1 <= t <= 100<br>
* 1 <= N <= 45<br>
* 1 <= A[i] <= 1000<br><br>
			<h3>Output Format</h3>
* For each test case print a single integer that represents the number of Kiruba's Favourite numbers in the array<br><br>
			<h3>Sample Input 0</h3>
2<br>
4<br>
1 5 15 20<br>
1<br>
6<br><br>
			<h3>Sample Output 0</h3>
2<br>
0<br><br>
			<h3>Explanation 0</h3>
* Case 1:<br>
* binary(1) => 1 => (01) => 0 | 1 .Therefore its not a favourite number.<br>
* binary(5) => 101 => (0101) => 01 | 01 .Therefore its a favourite number.<br>
* binary(15) => 1111 => (1111) => 11 | 11 .Therefore its a favourite number.<br>
* binary(20) => 10100 => (010100) => 010 | 100 .Therefore its not a favourite number.<br>
* Therefore there are 2 favourite number in the array.<br><br>
* Case 2: There are no such favourite numbers in the array<br>

			<h2>Problem 4: Rank of a Word</h2>
			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Given, a set of distinct lower case English alphabets, all sorted, various words are formed by permutating the given set of alphabets( each word must contain all the alphabets given ) and are arranged in lexicographic order. These words are ranked starting from 1.<br><br>Find the word for a given rank. If the given rank is greater than the number of available number of words, print -1<br><br>
			<h3>Input Format</h3>
* The first line contains a single integer t,representing the number of test cases<br>
* First line of each test case contains a single integer N,representing the number of alphabets<br>
* The second line ot each test case contains N space seperated lower case English alphabets<br>
* The third and the last line of each test case contains a single integer R, representing the rank of the word to be found.<br><br>
			<h3>Constraints</h3>
* 1 <= t <= 100<br>
* 1 <= N <= 10<br>
* 1 <= R <= 5 x 10^6<br>
* Each character given is always a lower case English alphabet<br><br>			
			<h3>Output Format</h3>
* For each test case print the word in the particular rank<br>
* If no word exist for a particular rank, print '-1'<br><br>
			<h3>Sample Input 0</h3>
2<br>
5<br>
a c d f g<br>
48<br>
3<br>
x y z<br>
8<br><br>
			<h3>Sample Output 0</h3>
cgfda<br>
-1<br><br>
			<h3>Explanation</h3>
* Case 1: The words formed by permutating letters 'a' 'c' 'd' 'f' and 'g' are ('acdfg', 'acdgf', 'acfdg', 'acfgd', .... , 'gfdac', 'gfdca'). In the following set of words, the rank 48 is taken by the word 'cgfda'.<br>
* Case 2: The total number of words formed by permutating 'x' 'y' and 'z' are 6. Therefore no word exist at rank 8.<br><br>
