Programmers are those who develop the design of success with all their experiences of failures, errors and warnings. Random Coders was an initiative to encourage such programmers to help build their skills in Competitive Programming, as it is like any other sport where you might know the rules but you have to play to learn. With the motto – ‘We Build Your Online Presence’, we have taken a step forward to develop your problem solving skills.<br><br></p>

The entire idea sparkled up during the boring COVID Quarantine. We, the people who considered programming to be fun, triggered the initiative by creating some simple challenges which required basic programming knowledge to solve. All such challenges weren’t challenges unless they were competitive. So, this motive encouraged us to host our first contest “RANDOM CODERS: CHAPTER - 1”. The astonishing response in our contest and support from our peer programmers paved way towards hosting a weekly programming contest series. Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. Thus, we introduced practice series to moralise the participants and push them a step forward in the difficulty ladder. Due to gaining support, the practice series was scheduled to occur twice a week.<br><br>
Hosting such contests is not only about creating new challenges but it also made us to learn other professional skills like, advertisement and promotion of contests, digital poster designing and web hosting. At the end of the day, it was beneficial not only for the participants but also for us, the creators.<br><br></p>

It’s not about its title “RANDOM CODERS”, it’s all about whose behind those wheels. All it took to start this initiative was just a great friendship. We, Rachit Dani, Jayan Praveen, Kirubanand R, Barath Kumar G, started this with just a simple faith. The family grew with veterans, S Manuj Nanthan and Sandeep V joining the squad. The job was done successfully by splitting the tasks among ourselves into various crews. Rachit Dani and Jayan Praveen, were part of Designing and Instagram Management Team, S Manuj Nanthan and Sandeep V, were part of Problem Setters Team of Practice Series, Kirubanand R and Barath Kumar G, were part of Problem Testers Team of Practice and Main Series and Problem Setters of Main Series. Barath Kumar G, took care of the Webpage Management and the Admin and Host of “RANDOM CODERS” contests.<br><br></p>
